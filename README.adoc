== Development

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 11+
* IDE
* Maven 3.6.2+
[[local-environment]]
* Docker (optional, for local development)

=== Development with profile `localstack`

https://github.com/localstack/localstack[localstack] enables local development without any AWS cloud access. +
We use the Docker container of localstack directly without the need to install any additional tool locally.

* For <<local-environment,local AWS development>>, simply power up the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the `src/docker` folder with `docker compose up` command. +
The container will start and initialize all the needed AWS resoures like DynamoDB, S3 bucket and files and SES, available at http://localhost:4566
* (Optional) Build application: `mvn clean package`
* Run application with `localstack` profile:
** With Maven, use https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#development-mode[Quarkus Development Mode]: `mvn compile quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.profile=localstack`
+
TIP: You can now change classes, configurations and other resources on the fly and Quarkus will automatically reload on the next call.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If an error occurs: "software.amazon.awssdk.core.exception.SdkClientException: Unable to load credentials from any of the providers in the chain", you need to set following env variables (dummy value is ok for localstack usage, it will automatically set when using the IntelliJ localstack run config):
----
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dummy
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=dummy
----
====

** In IntelliJ start via run configuration:
+
image::src/main/asciidoctor/images/intellij-run-configuration-dev.png[]
+
IMPORTANT: Change the `dev` profile in the image with `localstack`
+
TIP: This makes it even possible to run the application in debug mode.

=== Run HTTP requests to test registration

[source]
----
include::registration-requests.http[]
