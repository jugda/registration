== Development

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 11+
* IDE
* Maven 3.6.2+
[[local-environment]]
* Docker (optional, for local development)

=== Development with localstack

https://github.com/localstack/localstack[localstack] enables local development without any AWS cloud access. +
We use the Docker container of localstack directly without the need to install any additional tool locally.

* For <<local-environment,local AWS development>>, simply power up the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root with `docker compose up` command. +
The container will start and initialize all the needed AWS resoures like DynamoDB, S3 bucket and files and SES, available at http://localhost:4566
* (Optional) Build application: `mvn clean package`
* Run application with `dev` profile:
** With Maven, use https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#development-mode[Quarkus Development Mode]: `mvn compile quarkus:dev`
+
TIP: You can now change classes, configurations and other resources on the fly and Quarkus will automatically reload on the next call.
** In IntelliJ start via run configuration:
+
image::src/main/asciidoctor/images/intellij-run-configuration-dev.png[]
+
TIP: This makes it even possible to run the application in debug mode.
** TBD: How to start the application via CLI (`java -jar ...`)?
